## Data and Description

We got our crime data from the FBI's database from 2010-2015 and got our rent data for the same years from Zillow. We are interested to see if there is a correlation between crime rates and average rent in a city in the United States. Our predictor variable is crime rate and how it might explain rent prices in a city.
